# PubNub #

A Clojure [PubNub][pubnub] Client

## Installation ##

Pubnub is available in Clojars. Add this `:dependency` to your Leiningen
`project.clj`

```clojure
[pubnub "0.4.0"]
```

Or, add this to your Maven project's `pom.xml`

```xml
<repository>
  <id>clojars</id>
  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
  <groupId>pubnub</groupId>
  <artifactId>pubnub</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Pubnub is compatible with Clojure 1.5.1+.


## Usage ##

To get started, first we need to register a free [PubNub account][pubnub-account].
This will provide us with a PubNub Sandbox we can play in:


| Name          | Key                                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Subscribe Key	| sub-c-12345678-1111-2222-3333-123456789012             |
| Publish Key   | pub-c-87654321-1111-2222-3333-210987654321             |
| Secret Key    | sec-c-1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789012 |


With the keys we can define a configuration

```clojure
(def test-channel-conf
  {:channel       "test-channel"
   :client-id     "test-pubnub-client"
   :origin        "test.pubnub.com"
   :subscribe-key "sub-c-12345678-1111-2222-3333-123456789012"
   :publish-key   "pub-c-87654321-1111-2222-3333-210987654321"
   :secret-key    "sec-c-1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789012"})
```

to create a PubNub channel

```clojure
(def test-channel (channel test-channel-conf))
```

With the channel at hand, we can now publish messages to that channel:

```clojure
(publish test-channel "Hello World!")
(publish test-channel {:number 419 :ts (java.util.Date.)})
```

To receive any message published to the channel, we need
to subscribe to it. The subscription returns a Clojure [core.async][core.async]
channel that will contain any new message.

```clojure
(subscribed? test-channel)
(def subscription (subscribe test-channel))
(subscribed? test-channel)
```

Retrieve and process messages using any of the operations
core.async provides. E.g.

```clojure
(async/thread
  (loop []
    (when-let [msg (async/<!! subscription)]
      (println msg)
      (recur)))
  (println "Unsubscribed"))
```

When we do not want to receive any additonal messages,
simply unsubscribe:

```clojure
(pn/unsubscribe test-channel)
(pn/subscribed? test-channel)
```

It is important to note that *only* messages posted to the channel
*after* the client subscribed to it are received. I.e. the client
will not receive any historic messages.


## Best Practices ##

The client is built around [PubNub's Best Practices][pubnub-best-practices].

### Use SSL ###

By default the connection uses SSL. To disable it, simply set `ssl?`
to `false` in the configutation

```clojure
(def test-channel-conf
  {:channel "test-channel"
   ;; ...
   :ssl?    false})
```

### Client UUID ###

If no client-id is provided in the configuration, a UUID client-id is
generated. The generated UUID will change everytime the channel is
created, even with eveything else being the same.


## ToDo ##

* Hookup presence
* Support EDN as data format
* Handle PubNub errors for publish
    * "Message Too Big" - Max message size exceeded.
    * "Invalid Publish Key" - Wrong Publish Key was Used.
    * "Invalid Message Signature" - The message was SHA256 Signed incorrectly.
* Support connect/disconnect/reconnect events
* Add timeouts to subscribe/presence
* Write documentation
* Support proxy server (server, port)
* Look into using persistent connections (https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http#using-persistent-connections)
