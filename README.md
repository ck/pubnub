# PubNub #

[PubNub][pubnub] Client for Clojure

## Installation ##

Pubnub is available in Clojars. Add this `:dependency` to your Leiningen
`project.clj`:

```clojure
[pubnub "0.1.0"]
```

Or, add this to your Maven project's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repository>
  <id>clojars</id>
  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>

<dependency>

  <artifactId>pubnub</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Pubnub is compatible with Clojure 1.5.1+.


## Usage ##

To get started, we first need to register a
[free PubNub account][pubnub-account].

This will provide us with a PubNub Sandbox we can play in:


| Name          | Key                                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Subscribe Key	| sub-c-12345678-1111-2222-3333-123456789012             |
| Publish Key	| pub-c-87654321-1111-2222-3333-210987654321             |
| Secret Key	| sec-c-1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789012 |


Use the values in the configuration

```clojure
(def test-channel-conf
  {:channel       "test-channel"
   :client-id     "test-pubnub-client"
   :origin        "test.pubnub.com"
   :subscribe-key "sub-c-12345678-1111-2222-3333-123456789012"
   :publish-key   "pub-c-87654321-1111-2222-3333-210987654321"
   :secret-key    "sec-c-1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789012"})
```

to define a PubNub channel

```clojure
(def test-channel (channel test-channel-conf))
```


## Best Practices ##

The client is built around [PubNub's Best Practices][pubnub-best-practices].

### Use SSL ###

By default the connection uses SSL. To disable it, simply set `ssl?`
to `false` in the configutation

```clojure
(def test-channel-conf
  {:channel "test-channel"
   ;; ...
   :ssl?    false})
```

### Client UUID ###

If no client-id is provided in the configuration, a UUID client-id is
generated. The generated UUID will change everytime the channel is
created, even with eveything else being the same.


## ToDo ##

* Support EDN as data format
* Handle PubNub errors for publish
    * "Message Too Big" - Max message size exceeded.
    * "Invalid Publish Key" - Wrong Publish Key was Used.
    * "Invalid Message Signature" - The message was SHA256 Signed incorrectly.
* Add error handling to subscribe (fn)
* Support connect/disconnect/reconnect events
* Support cipher
* Add timeouts to subscribe/presence
* Write documentation
* Support proxy server (server, port)
* Look into using persistent connections (https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http#using-persistent-connections)
